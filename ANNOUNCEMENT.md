# CYBERJUNK OCTAFEST 2021

🎉 **Website Creation Competition** 🌏

Calling all Web Devs and Designers! We now have a platform for you to put your skills to the test. The objective is simple: Create a website for the company ‘Cyberjunk’. Cyberjunk is a cybersecurity-focused company, which collects and provides the best resources available, within clicking distance.

We encourage the web devs out there to participate and get their creative juices flowing. The websites will be judged based on designs, functionality, and layouts. The winners will be declared live at the event and will be awarded a special prize at that time, and their website will be seen to all as the company’s main web page.
